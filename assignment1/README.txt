"fastText.ipynb"                    : A classifier with the fastText model. 
                                             : I put this model in a separate document because I run it on google VM.
"labelTextForFastText.ipynb": I labeled all of the data in this document according to the requirement of FastText model.
		               I build the fastText model on the google VM but I found it would spend too much time to
		               upload 50000 records to the VM. So I labeled all of the data on my local computer and 
		               upload a whole text file to the VM.
		               Ignore this program if you have no interest.
